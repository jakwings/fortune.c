* ASCII letters are still rotated by 13 places.
* Non-ASCII code units use a rot13-like algorithm for rotation.

Have fun!


2016-08-25: Version 1.0.0

This is the first version.

It is a simplified fortune cookie generator inspired by the BSD one.
The original fortune generator has some insignificant bugs, unnecessary
features and an ugly code style.  I can't stand the old implementation,
thus making this shiny new tool.  :-P
