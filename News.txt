2016-09-23: Version 1.0.1

Fix some logic about delimiters and comments in cookie source.


2016-08-25: Version 1.0.0

This is the first version.

It is a simplified fortune cookie generator inspired by the BSD one.
The original fortune generator has some insignificant bugs, unnecessary
features and an ugly code style.  I can't stand the old implementation,
thus making this shiny new tool.  :-P
